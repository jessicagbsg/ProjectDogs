Project of a social media for dogs developed using ReactJS

## About the project

The main purpuse of this project was to put to use what I have learned of ``ReactJS``, ``React Hooks``, `` React Components``, consuming and creating ``API``, ``CSS modules``.

This is a complete social media website, where you can create an account or login if you already have one, post new photos on your profile or delete them, comment on  users photos, see how many views the photos have, and look at the statistics of your profile. 

### Other tools used

* ``Git`` was used to keep track of the versioning
* ``ESLint`` was used to find and fix pattern problems
* ``WebPack`` was used as module bundler
* ``Babel`` was used as transcompiler.


### Running the project
